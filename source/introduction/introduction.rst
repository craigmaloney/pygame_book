Introduction
************

In your hands (or on your screen) is yet-another-Pygame book. But what makes this one different from the plethora of thero Pygame books out there?

* This is not an introduction: If you're not familiar with Python this book is not the best place to start. I'd highly recommend checking out Al Sweigart's "Invent with Python" or "Making Games with Pygame". Both will give you a great foundation for the material presented in this book.
* No installation instructions. This book assumes you have already installed Python and are familiar with getting Pygame up and working. If you haven't installed Python or Pygame yet now would be a great time to look for your machine specific instructions to install both Python and Pygame. Unfortunately operating systems and installation methods can change faster than a bok can keep up so we'll assume you've already done the hard work.
* No admonitions for picking the right editor, right source code control, or even right operating system. I'm assuming that you're comfortable with your editor, source code control system and operating system. If you're not quite there you'll want to get comfortable as soon as possible. You should be able to edit your code quickly and confidently, keep track of old revisions, and be comfortable enough in your chosen operating system to get things done. It's up to you to determine if you're at that level and where you need to improve.
* Worked examples: The examples in this book will move beyond the basic scaffolding for creating a game and dive into the process for creating actual games that could easily be published. Too often the hard work of polishing the final game is left as an exercise for the reader. Not here. We'll cover the spit and polish required for taking a game through design, development, debugging, dissection, deployment and delivery. By the end of this book you'll have a clear understanding of what is needed to take a game from concept to completion. 
* This book will cover more of the bits that other books tend to overlook or only cover in minute detail. We'll cover Pygame Sprites, and show where they can be useful and where you might not want to use them. We'll use libraries like Pyscroll and PyTMX for creating scrolling, tiled environments for our game. 
* This book does not purport to be the final word on anything. I'm not a professional game developer; I'm just a guy who really loves games. We'll be learning together. I'll document my mistakes and we'll learn from them together. They say that the best way to learn is to teach so I'll be learning with you, and your feedback will help me learn as well. 
* This book is a living document. What you are reading is but a snapshot in time of the book's progress. As new material becomes available the book will grow and expand. Based on your feedback and suggestions this book will improve. This is a collaboration between us, and with your participation this book will only improve.

This is a journey for both of us. I've been down this road a few times with some games that I wrote using Pygame. Some of them worked. Others needed more polish. Hopefully this book will help you move from creating simple technical demos and guide you toward creating finished, playable, and tested games. 

Again this is a collaborative effort. Together we will learn not only Pygame but also more about the game development process; the steps required to take a concept and turn it into a published game.

Let's get started.
