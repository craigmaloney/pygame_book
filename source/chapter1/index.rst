Chapter 1
=========

This chapter will cover the basic scaffolding for a Pygame game. We'll cover:
 * The basic structure of a Pygame program
 * Displaying a window on the screen
 * Some simple drawing primitives

By the end of this chapter you will have a simple program that displays a greeting; a "hello world" program if you will. This chapter is fundamental to the other chapters so please make sure you understand it before moving on to the other chapters.

The structure of a Pygame program
---------------------------------

Take a look at the following program:

.. literalinclude:: program1.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

Enter this program (or copy it) and run it using ``python program1.py``. You should see a window 800x600 pixels in size quickly appear and disappear. If you miss it try running it again.

Let's break down the program.

.. literalinclude:: program1.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 1-4
    :linenos:

Line 1 tells Unix-basesd systems to search the environment path for a Python interpreter.

Line 3 imports the Python system library (which we'll use to exit the program, along with pygame.quit()).

Line 4 imports the Pygame library.

.. literalinclude:: program1.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 4
    :lineno-start: 4
    :linenos:
