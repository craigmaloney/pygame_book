In the next few chapters we'll create our first game. We'll go through the process of creating a variant of the classic game "Space Invaders", up to the point where we release the game. We'll forgo making a proper release for this game for the following reasons:

 * Space Invaders generated hundreds of clones.
 * We're mimicking the game mechanics to better understand game development, not to release a finished project.
 * We have nothing to add to the mechanics of Space Invaders.
 * Space Invaders is still receiving updates and development by Taito, and I'd rather not receive a cease and desist from them while learning how to code.

 We will be creating our own graphics and "assets" for this game. I'll go through how I create those assets as we progress.
