Our first game
==============

In the next few chapters we'll create our first game. We'll go through the process of creating a variant of the classic game "Snake", up to the point where we release the game. We'll forego making a proper release for this game for the following reasons:

 * Snake has hundreds of clones, ranging from versions on older computers to versions on flip-phones.
 * We're mimicking the game mechanics to better understand game development, not to release a finished project.
 * We have nothing to add to the mechanics of Snake. We're just learning how to create a game.

We will be creating our own graphics and "assets" for this game. I'll go through how I create those assets as we progress.
